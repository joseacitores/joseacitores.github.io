Pancreatic cancer (PC) is often diagnosed late, as early symptoms and effective screening tools are lacking, and genetic or familial factors explain only ~10% of cases. Leveraging longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data may offer a promising avenue for early detection. We developed a predictive model using large language model (LLM)-derived embeddings of medical condition names to enhance learning from EHR data.
