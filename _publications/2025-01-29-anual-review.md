Cancer remains a leading cause of death globally. The complexity and diversity of cancer-related datasets across different specialties pose challenges in refining precision medicine for oncology. Foundation models offer a promising solution. Trained on vast amounts of data, these models develop a broad understanding across a wide range of tasks. We examine the role of foundation models in domains relevant to cancer research, including natural language processing, computer vision, molecular biology, and cheminformatics.
